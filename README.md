# Hoare

This Project is a visualization demo for several sorting algorithms:

-   Quick Sort
-   Merge Sort
-   Insersion Sort
-   Shell Sort
-   Bubble Sort
-   Cocktail Shaker Sort
-   Comb Sort
-   Counting Sort

See details of these algorithms [here](https://github.com/frostace/LeetCode/blob/master/Sort/912.%20Sort%20an%20Array.md).

Vuex is used for state management while d3.js is used for chart visualization.

Animations are implemented by asynchronous operations.

Enjoy!
