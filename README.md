# Sorting-Visualization

This Project is a visualization demo for 3 sorting algorithms:

* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insersion Sort

See details of these algorithms [here](https://github.com/frostace/LeetCode/blob/master/Sort/912.%20Sort%20an%20Array.md).

Vuex is used for state management while d3.js is used for chart visualization.

Animations are implemented by asynchronous operations.

Enjoy!
